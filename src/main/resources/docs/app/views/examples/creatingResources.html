    <h2>Creating REST Resources:</h2>

    <p>Creating REST resources is easy to do. Simply use the static function:
    <pre>GServ.Resource<(name, config)</pre>
    <br/>
    Here, we will reate a Books REST resource with 2 method GET
    </p>
<pre>
def gserv = new GServ()
def bookService = ...
/// Create a Books REST resource

/* the root path is passed to the GServ.resource() method
along with a closure defining the endpoints or the resource
*/

def bkResource = gserv.resource("/books") {
      ////
      // responds  to /books/faq
      get("/faq", file("BooksFaq.html"))
      // responds  to /books/xyz
      get(":id"), { id ->
          def book = bookService.get( id )
          writeJSON(book)
      }
      // responds  to /books/all
      get("/all", {  ->
        def books = bookService.allBooks ()
        writeJSON(books)
    })
}

// The http() method creates a GServInstance that can later listen on a port and handle REST requests

gserv.http {
    // setup a directory for static files
    static_root ("webapp")
    /// add Book REST resources to our GServ instance
    resource(bkResource)
}.start(8080);
</pre>

</div>
