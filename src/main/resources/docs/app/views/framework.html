<span class="docs-header">gServ Framework</span>
<div class="docs-content">
    gServ framework provides a container-free way to expose new or existing functionality as a REST based service.
    <hr/>
    <div class="docs-content">
        <p class="docs-sub-header">Getting Started</p>
        <li>Download and install <a href="http://www.gradle.org/downloads">Gradle</a></li>
        <li>Clone gServ from <a href="https://github.com/javaConductor/gserv.git">GitHub</a></li>
        <li>At the commandline, in the root directory of the gServ project, run:
            <pre>prompt> gradle install</pre>
            This will add it to your local Maven repository as <strong>'io.github.javaconductor:gserv:[latest version]'</strong>
            so you can use it your Maven/Gradle apps or just get the jar file and use it directly..
        </li>

        <p class="docs-sub-header">Creating REST Resources:</p>
        Creating REST resources is easy to do. Either use the static or instance methods:
    <pre>
        GServ.Resource<(path, config)
        new GServ().resource<(path, config)</pre>
        The <i>path</i> argument contains the path prefix for this resource<br/>
        The <i>config</i> argument is a Closure defining the endpoint of this resource
        <br/>

        <p>
            Here, we will create a Books REST resource.
        </p>
<pre>
def gserv = new GServ()

/// Create a Books REST resource

/* the root path is passed to the GServ.resource() method
along with a closure defining the endpoints of the resource
*/
def bookService = ...

def bkResource = gserv.resource("/books") {
      ////
      // responds  to /books/faq
      get("/faq", file("text/html", "BooksFaq.html"))
      // responds  to /books/xyz
      get(":id"), { id ->
          def book = bookService.get( id )
          writeJson(book)
      }
      // responds  to /books/all
      get("/all", {  ->
        def books = bookService.allBooks ()
        header("content-type", "application/json")
        writeJSON(books)
    })
}
</pre>

<span>
    After this call, bkResource represents a resource with root '/books' and 3 actions:<br/>
    <li>GET path='/books/faq'</li>
    <li>GET path='/books/all'</li>
   <li>GET path='/books/:id' (where 'id' could be a book ID.)</li>
    This resource can now be added to a Service.

    <div class="docs-content">

        <p class="docs-sub-header">Composing resources into Services</p>
        <hr/>
   <span class="docs-content">Services are made of Resources, additional Routes and Config Settings
   Creating services in gServ is extremely simple.<br/>
   The following code creates an HTTP server and starts it listening to port 8080:
    </span>
   <pre>

    // The http() method creates a GServInstance
    gserv.http {
        // setup a directory for static files
        static_root ("webapp")
       useResources(true)
        /// add Book REST resources to our GServ instance
        resource(bkResource)
    }.start(8080);

   </pre>

    <span>In addition to serving the Books Resource, we also serve static docs from
        the folder 'webapp'.  This folder can be on the file-system or on the
        classpath.  <br/>The above call to useResourceDocs(true) tells gServ to look on the
        classpath as well as the "webapp" folder for static resources. </span>
