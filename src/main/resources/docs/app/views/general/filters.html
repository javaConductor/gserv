<h1>Defining Filters</h1>

<p>Server Config may include a Filter definitions.
    There are 3 builtin functions:
    <pre>
    before( name, url, method, options, order, filterBehaviorClosure )
        filterBehaviorClosure( ) returns HttpExchange
    after(name, url, method, options, order, filterBehaviorClosure)
        filterBehaviorClosure( HttpExchange, data) returns data or nothing
    filter(name, url, method, filterBehaviorClosure)
        filterBehaviorClosure( ) returns nothing
    </pre>

<p>As you can probably guess, before-filters are called <b>before</b> the Route code is called.
    Similarly, after-filters are called <b>after</b> the Route code is called and has a chance to modify the output
    produced by the Route.

<p>The filter may choose to: call a different Route, return a response or error, pre/post process the output of the
    Route processing.
    A filter may be passive and do nithin more than record activity rather than effect input or output.
</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>MatchedRoutesOnly</th>
        <td>Boolean</td>
        <td>If true, the filterBehaviorClosure will ONLY be called when the request path actually matches a resource
            route or static path. Default is false.

<h2>Filter Examples</h2>

<h3>Before Filter</h3>
<pre>
    // Add a filter to intercept and reject letters to 'Lee'
    before("rejectLee", "/letter/:name", "GET", [(FilterOptions.PassRouteParams): true] ) { name ->
        if ( name == "Lee")
            error(403, "Lee not allowed");
        else
            return exchange;
    }
    </pre>

<h3>After Filter</h3>
<pre>
    // Add a filter to capture the response and change its text to uppercase
    after("upperCaseFilter", "/letter/:name", "GET", [:] ) { exchange, data ->
        def newData = new String(data).toUpperCase().bytes;
        return newData;
    } </pre>
</body>
