<h1>Filter API</h1>

<p>In the GServ Config you can define filters. GServ defines 2 kinds of filters: After and Before<br/>
    As you can probably guess, before-filters are called <b>before</b> the Route code is called.<br/>
    Similarly, after-filters are called <b>after</b> the Route code is called and has a chance to modify the output
    produced by the Route.

<h2>Filter Examples</h2>

<h3>Before Filter</h3>
<pre>
    // Add a filter to intercept and reject letters to 'Lee'
    before("rejectLee", "/letter/:name", "GET", [(FilterOptions.PassRouteParams): true] ) { name ->
        if ( name == "Lee")
            error(403, "Lee not allowed");
        else
            nextFilter();
        return exchange;
    }
</pre>

<h3>After Filter</h3>
<pre>
    // Add a filter to capture the response and change its text to uppercase
    after("upperCaseFilter", "/letter/:name", "GET", [:] ) { exchange, data ->
        def newData = new String(data).toUpperCase().bytes;
        return newData;
