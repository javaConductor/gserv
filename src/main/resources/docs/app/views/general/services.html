    <p class="section-header">Creating Services</p>
    Services are composed of resources, staticRoots and filters.
    Creating services in gServ is extremely simple.

    The following code creates an HTTP server and starts it listening to port 8080:

    <p class="sub-section-header">Example</p>

    <p class="section-content">
        Create a folder: WelcomeTest
        In the new directory, add file 'build.gradle' with contents below:
    </p>
<pre>
apply plugin: 'groovy'
apply plugin: 'application'
apply plugin: 'maven'

mainClassName = 'WelcomeService'
version = "0.0.1"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()
}

// In this section you declare the dependencies for your production and test code
dependencies {
    // The production code uses the SLF4J logging API at compile time
    compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.5'
    compile 'log4j:log4j:1.2.17'
    compile('org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.3.0')
    compile("io.github.javaconductor:g-serv:0.0.1")

    /// needed for Grab/Grape
    groovy group: 'org.apache.ivy', name: 'ivy', version: '2.2.0'

    testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:0.7-groovy-2.0'
    testCompile "junit:junit:4.11"
}</pre>

    <p class="section-content">
        Copy the code below to WelcomeService.groovy in your WelcomeService folder.
<pre>import io.github.javaconductor.gserv.GServ
class WelcomeService {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new WelcomeService();
    }

    def WelcomeService() {
        def gserv = new GServ()

        gserv.http {
            get("/welcome", {->
                write("Welcome to g-serv, The embeddable REST server for Groovy!")
            });

        }.start(8080)
    }
}</pre>

    <p class="section-content">
        Tell Gradle to build and run your program.
<pre>
gradlew clean run
</pre>
    Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8080/welcome]. You should see the welcome message above in your
    browser.
    </p>

    You may add a single resource / method handler to the service but its usually
    more useful to group the operations in a resource together.
