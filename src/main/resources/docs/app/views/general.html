    <h2 class="docs-sub-header">What is gServ?</h2>
        <span class="docs-content">
            gServ is a tool for creating and deploying REST based services using Groovy without the
            hassle of a container (JBoss, Jetty, etc.) .  Using gServ, you can easily define
            REST resources as Groovy scripts or embed  gServ in your application. gServ is
            perfect for creating lightweight micro services.
