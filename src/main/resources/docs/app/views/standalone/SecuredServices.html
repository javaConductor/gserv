    <h1>GServ</h1>

    <h2>Creating Secure REST Service</h2>

    <h3>Create GServ Config</h3>

    <p> A GServ Config file is a regular JSON formatted file.
        Below is an example of a minimal config file:
    <pre>
{
    "apps" : [{
            "https": false,
            "name" : "Secured App Example",
            "resourceScripts" : ["resources/Resource1.groovy","resources/Resource2.groovy"],
            "port" : 11111,
            "static_roots" : [ "/Users/lcollins/src/main/resources/docs" ]
        }]
}
    </pre>
    The GServ config is required to have at least one application defined.
    The 'apps' element is a List of Application Definitions. Each entry in this list
    is separate App instance that will run on its own port. Port must be unique across app instances.
    Application Definitions can contain the following:
    <li><i>https</i>: boolean
    <li>name: String
    <li>resourceScripts(optional) : List&lt;String&gt; containing REST resource script file names
    <li>port: Integer port on which to listen for requests.</li>

    </p>
    <h3>Creating REST Resources</h3>

    <p>
        REST Resources Scripts define one or more Resources:
        <pre>

import io.github.javaconductor.gserv.*

[
        GServ.Resource("/hello") {
            get("/") {
                write("Hello World".bytes)
            }

            get("/:name") { name ->
                //println l
                write("Hello $name".toString().bytes)
            }

        }
]

        </pre>

    </p>
    <h3>Using REST Resources to Build a REST Service</h3>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Using Basic Authentication with your Service</h3>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Use HTTPS to Encrypt/Decrypt traffic to your REST Service</h3>

    <p> To use HTTPS, you will need to add an HTTPS section to your GServ config file.
